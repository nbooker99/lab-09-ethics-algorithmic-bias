## Load Packages and Data

First, let’s load the necessary packages:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(fairness)
```

### The data

For this lab, we’ll use the COMPAS dataset compiled by ProPublica. The
data has been preprocessed and cleaned for you. You’ll have to load it
yourself. The dataset is available in the `data` folder, but I’ve
changed the file name from `compas-scores-two-years.csv` to
`compas-scores-2-years.csv`. I’ve done this help you practice debugging
code when you encounter an error.

``` r
compas <- read_csv("data/compas-scores-2-years.csv")
```

    ## New names:
    ## Rows: 7214 Columns: 53

    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ
    ## Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
    ## • `decile_score` -> `decile_score...12`
    ## • `priors_count` -> `priors_count...15`
    ## • `decile_score` -> `decile_score...40`
    ## • `priors_count` -> `priors_count...49`

## Additional Exercises

Almost there! Keep building on your work and follow the same structure
for any remaining exercises. Each exercise builds on the last, so take
your time and make sure your code is working as expected.
